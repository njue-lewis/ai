here we will be building knwoledge based agents , 
agents that reason by operating on internal representations of knowledge .

 for example if it didints rain , rahhy visisted hagrid today .
 harry visited hadri or dumbledore today but not both , 

 harry visited dumbledore today . 

 harray di not visit hagrid today . 

when we turn our attentsion of this in computer we need to do the following : 
DEFINATION IN TERM OF AI
SENTENCE :  an assertion about the world in a knowledge respresentaion language . 


PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 

propersiqion sysbols 
p 
q
r
these represent some sentence connection we use logic connectores such as 

-> implication 
<-> biconditional 
~ not 

^ and 

v or 

those are the 5 most common ones 

model: 

assigment of a truth vaue to every propositional symbol ( a possible world)

knowledge base :  a set of sentancces known by a knowledge by a knowledge based agent . 

## ENTAILMENT 

a |= B 
we read alpha entails beta 


that means : 

in every model in which sentance alpha is true senctence beta is also true .
